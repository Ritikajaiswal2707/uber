# üöó Uber-Like Ride Sharing App

> **A modern, real-time ride-sharing application built with React and Node.js**

Hey there! üëã This is a full-stack Uber-like ride sharing application that I've built from scratch. Think of it as your personal "Uber Clone" with all the essential features you'd expect from a ride-sharing platform.

- **Real-time tracking** of captains and ride status
- **Authentication system** for both users and captains
- **Payment processing** (simulated)
- **Socket.io integration** for live updates
